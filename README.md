Including:  
-	[An improved DQN agent](https://github.com/ClemPalf/Deep-RL-agents/tree/main/Improved%20DQN), performing within an environment similar to [unity banana](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#banana-collector).  
-	[A DDPG agent](https://github.com/ClemPalf/Deep-RL-agents/tree/main/DDPG), performing within the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.
- 
- [An AlphaZero agent](https://github.com/ClemPalf/Deep-RL-agents/tree/main/AlphaZero), which learned TicTacToe (I did not yet documented the implementation).
